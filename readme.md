# MERN Stack Boilerplate

A boilerplate file structure for the MERN stack. MERN is a scaffolding tool which makes it easy to build isomorphic apps using Mongo, Express, React and NodeJS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you the latest version of this project up and running on your local mashine for testing and development purposes.

### Prerequesites

* **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** - A recent version of NodeJS, preferably version 8.11.2 or higher
* **MongoDB Instance** - [mlab](https://mlab.com/) is recommended

### Installing

A short guidance on how to setup the boilerplate on you local mashine.

After forfilling the prerequesites mentioned above, the project can be cloned with the following command in your git bash:

```
git clone https://github.com/F9lke/mern-boilerplate
```

Thanks to the use of MongoDB, it is not necessary to manually create the database structure. In order to make this database system work on the other hand, you will have to create a file called "keys_dev.js" inside the folder "config" with the following code:

```
module.exports = {
    mongoURI: 'YOUR MONGODB URI',
    secretOrKey: 'YOUR SECRET'
}
```

After you followed these instructions, you can now install the dependencies using npm with the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run client-install
```
